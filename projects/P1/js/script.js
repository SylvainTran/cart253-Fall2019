Goal of program: Modified version of chaser by Dr. Pippin Bar
The concept explored in this game is the original relation between man and woman
with the perspective of the Theology of the Body.

Twists: You can eat the forbidden fruit. Or...

Includes: Physics-based movement, keyboard controls, health/stamina,
random movement, screen wrap.
