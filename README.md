## Repository for Creative Computation I taught by Dr. Pippin Bar at Concordia University.

### Personal goals for the course
- Make progress in my journey to master the basics of Javascript;
- Learn more advanced OOP techniques;
- Learn how to design and code with Test-driven development (TDD);
- Make a mobile or web app as the final project;
- Give my 100% always;

### Exercise 1 completed on 2019-09-14.

### Developer's Journal:
I noticed during Exercise 1 that ECMA6 (2015+) added some syntatic sugar for classes. I had to re-learn (or de-learn) about prototypes and move on to the class and constructor functions. Not sure at this point if I will pick up Typescript. Noticed the usefulness of trigonometry in animation (learned how to use a sine wave function to oscillate an image -- using the p5.js reference).
Will make an effort to learn more maths. And physics. Bought a new book on Javascript -- Reliable Javascript. Reading Eloquent Javascript too. Feeling more motivated to learn again. Looking forward to apply new techniques and concepts in a bigger project.
I also noted that I forget to commit after making some changes. Gotta re-learn how to integrate git to my workflow...
