## Repository for Creative Computation I taught by Dr. Pippin Bar at Concordia University.

### Personal goals for the course
- Make progress in my journey to master the basics of Javascript;
- Learn more advanced OOP techniques;
- Learn how to design and code with Test-driven development (TDD);
- Make a mobile or web app as the final project;
- Give my 100% always;

### Exercise 1 completed on 2019-09-14.

### Progress Log 
I noticed during Exercise 1 that ECMAScript6 (2015+) added some syntatic sugar for classes. I had to re-learn (or unlearn) about prototypes and move on to the class and constructor functions. Not sure at this point if I will pick up Typescript. Noticed the usefulness of trigonometry in animation (learned how to use a sine wave function to oscillate an image -- using the p5.js reference).
Bought a new book on Javascript -- Reliable Javascript. Reading Eloquent Javascript too. Feeling more motivated to learn again. Looking forward to apply new techniques and concepts in a bigger project.
I also noted that I forget to commit after making some changes. Gotta re-learn how to integrate git to my workflow...

### Javascript Study
Eloquent JS
##
```javascript
Arrow Functions 
function Test(a, b, c) => x * x; // No need for "return" keyword
```

## Call Stack
Function control is stored in the call stack. The function call context is retrieved from popping the top of the stack after a call to a function is completed.

In JS, all functions are pushed at the top of their scope, so one may declare a function after or before the function call.

## Default Parameters
Like in C++, one can supply default values to arguments using the '=' assignment operator in the argument list to substitute a missing missing argument used in the block of the function.
