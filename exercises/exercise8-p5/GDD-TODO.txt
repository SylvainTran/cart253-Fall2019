Melansuko: The Decades Day Album
Author: Sylvain Tran

Pitch:
++Player can drag stuff and shove it down our character Allison, who is
basically living the years of her life. This is a slice of life game.
++The real story is that the Ally believed that it was her mom that had amnesia (and potentially schizophrenia)
and throughout the game is trying to gradually recover memories of "her lost daughter" after she sadly passed away.
This is in fact a fabrication; the player eventually discovers that Ally is recalling her own memories, and the game
follows her undergoing some futuristic amnesia therapy.
+Consider basing the game on real therapy methods.
++Mechanics wise, the idea is to cancel the need for real movement by displaying an illusion
of it, and having the character seemingly move while it is the background
that moves, along with the events and encounters in her life that she witnesses.
++Idea of memories going around in a loop when people ruminate about their
life. Also, Allison gets stuck in a vinyl.
++Many different characters to illustrate the slice-of-life + surrealistic setting of this game
++Perhaps some combat, fun task-mechanic to add in Ally's more turbulent life phases, RPG-style.
+Dialogue options for different endings and conversations.
+Tile-based? Turn-based combat...

Summary:
++Click to wash the dishes... follow Allison's estranged/neglected childhood
++Levels are slices of life, common things.
++Different kind of visualization of the main characters' emotions.
++Trigonometry play for animations and some level obstacles
+Basic fake platformer ("big sprite game going through life obstacles")
"some restricted jumping" and "task grabbing"
+Weird UI

Characters:
+Mixin really weird ideas as follows:
+Melansuko, Ally's mother who is trapped washing dishes in a surrealistic
looping vinyl.
+Coffee Spirit idea: taking the perspective of a coffee cup
for a period of time.
+Ally's dad, who is an Honest Politician TM who has to manage public expectations
and reach the platform's goals.
+The Mage Brother, who is trying to teach Ally and help her.
+Wealthy Princess Director kind of game: Guide spoiled Ally as she goes
through the loss of her turtle and breaks up with her boyfriend.
+Finally, the AMBER Alert grandma hero, bored and watching TV. Call
the cops when you spot anomalies in the news.

Development Diary:
===
Extend the idea of the emotion visualization primarily.
to react with player movement (Hot and Cold system)
as she gets nearer to certain objects in the scene. (Cancelled idea)

Or maybe she needs to put out a small fire in order to build
some heat. Or maybe she needs to stop listen to the cacophony
by journaling (press shift to begin journaling) repeatedly on place. (Maybe)

Those would be "emotional memories" that the player has to collect. (No)

The idea is that the player can play mini-games in each scene,
such as click on certain areas of the environment to move them away
or interact in some way or just enjoy watching the character's life. (Yes)

Font history: Zeyada:
Zeyada is based on the handwriting of a warm and generous young mom.

Her family sponsors an amazing Ethiopian young woman named Zeyada and pays for her to continue to be in school.
This font has curls and curves and is not a typical cursive, nor a typical print. It is slightly connected, but
not a traditional script in any way.
