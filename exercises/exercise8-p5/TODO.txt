Melansuko: The Decades Day Album
Author: Sylvain Tran

++Idea of memories going around in a loop when people ruminate about their
life: Also, she gets stuck in a vinyl
++Slice of life
++Click to wash the dishes... follow Allison's estranged/neglected childhood
+Levels are slices of life, common things.
++Different kind of visualization of the main characters' emotions.
++Trigonometry play for animations and some level obstacles
+Basic fake platformer ("big sprite game going through life obstacles")
  "some restricted jumping"
+Weird UI
+Mixin really weird ideas:
+Melansuko, Ally's mother who is trapped washing dishes in a surrealistic
looping vinyl.
+Coffee Spirit idea: taking the perspective of a coffee cup
for a period of time.
+Ally's dad, who is an Honest Politician TM who has to manage public expectations
and reach the platform's goals.
+The Mage Brother, who is trying to teach Ally and help her.
+Wealthy Princess Director kind of game: Guide spoiled Ally as she goes
through the loss of her turtle and breaks up with her boyfriend.
+Finally, the AMBER Alert grandma hero, bored and watching TV. Call
the cops when you spot anomalies in the news.

Extend the idea of the emotion visualization primarily.
to react with player movement (Hot and Cold system)
as she gets nearer to certain objects in the scene.

Or maybe she needs to put out a small fire in order to build
some heat. Or maybe she needs to stop listen to the cacophony
by journaling (press shift to begin journaling) repeatedly on place.

Those would be "emotional memories" that the player has to collect.

The second thing is that the player can click on certain areas of the
environment to move them away or interact in some way.
